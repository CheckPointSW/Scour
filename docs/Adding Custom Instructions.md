Adding Custom Instructions
==========================
Being an instruction-based debugger, Scout supports project extensions.

Registration - C Code
---------------------
* Each of the instructions that are added by the project, should be registerred by calling ``register_instruction()``.
* The registration should take place inside the function ``register_specific_instructions()``.
* This design makes sure that when invoking ``register_all_instructions()``, all of the default instructions, and extension instruction, will be registerred correctly.

Implementation - C Code
-----------------------
In order to implement a new instruction, one should define each of the required parts:

* Instruction ID - must be unique, but not necessarily consecutive
* Minimal Length - minimal amount of bytes needed for a valid instruction (robustness checks)
* Maximal Length - maximal amount of bytes needed for a valid instruction (robustness checks)
* Instruction handler - a handler function with a fixed signature of: ``int32_t (*instrHandler)(void * ctx, uint8_t * instruction, uint32_t length)``

**Note:** The instructions are stored in a global array with a **fixed** capacity. When adding new instructions, one should make sure to adjust this capacity accordingly (both in the C and .py files).
The capacity is defined in ``scout_api.h`` and is set by default to ``#define SCOUT_MAX_INSTRS   (10)``.

Examples - C Code
-----------------
* Embedded mode (``embedded_scout``) - files ``project_instructions`` (*.c and *.h)
* Linux Kernel mode (``kernel_scout``) - files ``driver\scout_kernel_instructions`` (*.c and *.h)

Client Side - Python Code
-------------------------
In the client side, adding a new instructions is even easier, and requires only 2 definitions:

* Defining the Instruction ID (as was defined in the C code)
* Implementing a serializer for the instruction

Examples - Python Code
----------------------
* Embedded example (``manager``) - file ``embedded_scout_api.py``
* Linux Kernel example (``manager``) - file ``kernel_scout_api.py``
